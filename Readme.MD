# Signal R Chat APP

This is a simple chat application that uses Signal R on the backend to manage websocket connections
to the server. This application can be run by going inside the SingalRChat folder and running the command 
``` dotnet run ```

You can then navigate to localhost:3000 where the React frontend is located.
